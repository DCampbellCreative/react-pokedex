# ReactDex

<p>A Pokédex created using create-react-app, lodash, pokeapi.co, and React.

Loads and displays a list of Pokémon from pokeapi.co and displays their names and sprites.

Backgrounds created using duiker101's Github repo pokemon-type-svg-icons.

The list is searchable by name, and sortable by number or name ascending and descending.

Clicking on a list item loads a modal showing front and back sprites, height, and types of desired Pokémon.</p>

### `npm start`
